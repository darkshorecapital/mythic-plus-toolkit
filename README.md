# Darkshore Capital's Mythic Plus Toolkit - V9.1.5-01
The Mythic+ Toolkit is a set of import strings for the Trade Skill Master (TSM) addon that make it easy to buy everything you need from the auction house to succeed in mythic+ dungeons. I took the extra time to make the experience beginner friendly and as easy and straight forward as possible. 

# Required Addons
In order to use the toolkit you'll need to install Trade Skill Master (https://www.tradeskillmaster.com/). I highly reccomend doing the full setup of the addon, including the desktop app to enable real time pricing data. You'll need to create an account and follow the installation steps here: https://www.tradeskillmaster.com/install

# Usage
Click on the folder that coresponds to your class. For example if you're playing a Shaman, click on "Shaman" (https://github.com/darkshorecapital/mythic-plus-toolkit/tree/main/Shaman). Then click on the text file coresponding to the spec you're playing. If youi're playing a restoration Shaman, click on "Restoration.txt" (https://github.com/darkshorecapital/mythic-plus-toolkit/blob/main/Shaman/03%20Restoration.txt). Copy the contents of the file, and head over to World of Warcraft. Once in game, open up the TSM configuration window by entering "/tsm" in your chat box. Navigate to the "Groups" header. Click on the import button, in the upper left area of the groups display. Paste the text you copied into the prompt and hit import.

You should now see the array of groups that make up the Mythic+ toolkit. To use the toolkit, head to your nearest Auction House, and navigate to the TSM tab. In the TSM window, cnavigate to the Browse window, you should see all your imported groups displayed. First click on the root group "Mythic+ Toolkit - By Darkshore Capital" and then run a shopping scan, you will see a list of all the items you'll want to purchase to help you in Mythic Plus.

The toolkit comes configured out of the box to purchase full stacks (of 20 for most items) automatically when you select an item to buy. You can of course adjust this at the time of purchase if you want more or less. 

Now head over to the mailbox and pick up all your items, form up a group with some trusty adventurers and attack some Mythic+ Dungeons!
